  <!-- Nice implementation of JS in in showing the information. Change for next time, I noticed that the other "tabs" doesn't close or hide immediately when other tabs are clicked. They're basically  overlapping each other and when you clicked the "Current positions" again you'll see the "Research Projects" information. All good so far for your 1st project.--->
